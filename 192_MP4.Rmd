# Gender Behind the Scenes of Your Favorite Movies


Recently, there have been many movements related to gender issues. Particularly in the workplace, there is increased women's voice against discrimination and greater inclusivity and equality in the workplace. But has any progress been made yet? Could numbers tell us some insights?

Dr. Stacy Smith from the University of Southern California studies studied [900 movies](https://annenberg.usc.edu/sites/default/files/Dr_Stacy_L_Smith-Inequality_in_900_Popular_Films.pdf)  from 2007 to 2017. She found that what is shown on screen is a highly male dominated world. The ratio of male to female is 2.3 to 1 and the percentage of women presented on screen has not improved significantly since a decade ago.

There has been much attention given to the inclusion and portrayal of actors and actresses in movies. We often forget what there are much more to movie production then what is on screen. Behind the scenes are large teams of people occupying different roles who shape the visuals, content, and intent of movies. They make critical decisions about the characters presented on screen and how they are portrayed. These behind the scene roles include but not limited to producers, writers, composers, costume designers, directors, and cinematographers. 

Have you ever wondered how inclusive/ gender balance is in each role?

Looking at 450 US movies that are considered popular movies from 2008 to present in the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) gives a glimpse into the film industry workplace inclusivity.

```


There is appearant gender imbalance in all roles. Particularly, female directors, composers, and cinematographers make up less than 5 percent of the total number. There are slightly more female writers and producers in comparison. In contrast,the female significantly outnumber males in costume design. 

Looking at the numbers, one might hypothesize whether females are less capable in areas such as directing and more capable in costume design. To further investigate this question, take a look at the performance of each films, in terms of their rating and gross earnings.

It seems that there is no performance difference between the films produced by males or females. Films made by female directors do not produce films that has lower rating or earn less revenue and it is the same for films made by male costume designers. This data counters the earlier assumption and points to an insight that is present in Dr. Stacy Smith¡¯s TED talk The data behind Hollywood's sexism. There is a lack of female directors due to ingrained gender stereotype that females are not suitable for leadership positions. Similarly in costume design, [a workspace traditionally thought of as feminine](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/22/gender-bias-film-industry-75-percent-male). 

Numbers can provide some clues but cannot tell the full story. Whether you find the numbers shocking or surprising, it might be too soon to come to a conclusion. The movies in this studies are collected from a biased selection of movies with votes greater than 10,000. The popularity of a movie might not truly reflect its quality since it can be largely impacted by the venue and timing of showing, advertisement method, genre, popularity of the actors/actresses¡­ and so on. Further investigation of greater range of movies are required to obtain more accurate information. 

Nevertheless, these number reveal that the film industry is still a male dominate world and gender bias is one likely factor that contributes to the gender division in the film industry. The paper "Gender Stereotypes Are Alive, Well, and Busy Producing Workplace Discrimination" published by Cambridge University, further delineates how gender bias in workplace are is still prominent in the contemporary society.

It is important to note that women made significant impact in the film world. Garrett Bradley is a young 32-year-old director and alumni of Smith College who won the prestigious 2017 Sundance Film Festival jury award. Bradley¡¯s films give rare opportunities of seeing the world through the perspective of a women of color. Many recent papers shows that gender diversity is beneficial for the environment and prosperity of the film industry. "Female Directors And Firm Performance" published by the [Kwik Kian Gie School of Business](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317183034_FEMALE_DIRECTORS_AND_FIRM_PERFORMANCE_EVIDENCE_FROM_THE_UK_LISTED_FIRMS?enrichId=rgreq-28cf48989bff249ec4e0ef497945aa8b-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMxNzE4MzAzNDtBUzo0OTkxNjcwMzU0MzI5NjBAMTQ5NjAyMjEwMzQ3NQ%3D%3D&el=1_x_2&_esc=publicationCoverPdf) reveals that gender diversity improves creativity and decision making for better problem solvings, which leads to positive results on film market. It is time for us to pay more attention to the gender division in the film industry. Less number does not mean less capability.
